# React Pokedex Project

## Background

I completed this project as part of the [Code Louisville](https://codelouisville.org/) program. It's purpose was to utilize the knowledge of React I've gained over the past few weeks to create a dynamic application which displays data retrieved through API calls.

## Functionality

The app brings up a list of pokemon, paginated in groups of twelve. Use the "prev" and "next" buttons to page through the list. Clicking on a given pokemon's tile will bring up some details and stats for it. The "back" button will return you to your current page in the list. Enjoy!
